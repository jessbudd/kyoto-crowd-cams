# Kyoto crowd cams

[Kyoto](https://kyoto.travel/en/) is a culturally significant city in Japan with a number of very famous tourist locations. These locations can become intensely busy, with shoulder-to-shoulder crowds, particularly in cherry blossom and autumn foliage seasons.

Kyoto city set up a number of live stream webcams in an effort to educate and encourage tourists to visit these spots at less busy times. This repo simply combines the live streams onto one page.

            is a culturally significant city in Japan with a number of
            world-famous tourist locations. However these locations can become
            intensely busy with shoulder-to-shoulder crowds, particularly in

            Kyoto city set up a number of live stream webcams in an effort to

              >crowd congestion forecast</a

            feeds so I could easily monitor the intensity of crowds at different
            times of day, in preparation for our once in a life-time family trip
            to Japan.
